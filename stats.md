How to determine mean and standard deviation of two blended datasets for which you know their means and standard deviations (and maybe Ns) but for which you've lost the original data.



1) What is cointegration? 3)  

4) What are the problems that one comes across when constructing a covariance matrix?

5) Which is more important in a factor regression - beta or R square?

Two (or more) integrated time series are said to be cointegrated if some linear combination of them is stationary.


What are the problems of using a mean variance optimization?

Although the covariances of a few assets can be adequately estimated, it is difficult to come up with reasonable estimates of expected returns.
1. Highly concentrated portfolios
2. Sensitive to changes in expected returns



 2) What is a view in a black-litterman model?




Time Series Vs Regression Modeling

Regression and time series can both answer the same question and technically, time series is technically regression (albeit auto-regression). Time series models are less complex and therefore more robust than regression models. If you think about specialization, then TS models specialize in forecasting whereas regression specialize in understanding. It boils down to whether you want to explain or predict.

Regression Algorithms Regression is concerned with modeling the relationship between variables that is iteratively refined using a measure of error in the predictions made by the model.

Regression methods are a workhorse of statistics and have been co-opted into statistical machine learning. This may be confusing because we can use regression to refer to the class of problem and the class of algorithm. Really, regression is a process.

The most popular regression algorithms are:



Instance-based Algorithms

Instance-based learning model is a decision problem with instances or examples of training data that are deemed important or required to the model.

Such methods typically build up a database of example data and compare new data to the database using a similarity measure in order to find the best match and make a prediction. For this reason, instance-based methods are also called winner-take-all methods and memory-based learning. Focus is put on the representation of the stored instances and similarity measures used between instances.

The most popular instance-based algorithms are:

k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN)
Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ)
Self-Organizing Map (SOM)
Locally Weighted Learning (LWL)
Regularization Algorithms

Regularization Algorithms

An extension made to another method (typically regression methods) that penalizes models based on their complexity, favoring simpler models that are also better at generalizing.

I have listed regularization algorithms separately here because they are popular, powerful and generally simple modifications made to other methods.

The most popular regularization algorithms are:

Ridge Regression
Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO)
Elastic Net
Least-Angle Regression (LARS)
Decision Tree Algorithms

Decision Tree AlgorithmsDecision tree methods construct a model of decisions made based on actual values of attributes in the data.

Decisions fork in tree structures until a prediction decision is made for a given record. Decision trees are trained on data for classification and regression problems. Decision trees are often fast and accurate and a big favorite in machine learning.

The most popular decision tree algorithms are:

Classification and Regression Tree (CART)
Iterative Dichotomiser 3 (ID3)
C4.5 and C5.0 (different versions of a powerful approach)
Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID)
Decision Stump
M5
Conditional Decision Trees





Bayesian Algorithms

Bayesian methods are those that explicitly apply Bayesâ€™ Theorem for problems such as classification and regression.

The most popular Bayesian algorithms are:

Naive Bayes
Gaussian Naive Bayes
Multinomial Naive Bayes
Averaged One-Dependence Estimators (AODE)
Bayesian Belief Network (BBN)
Bayesian Network (BN)
Clustering Algorithms




Clustering Algorithms


Clustering, like regression, describes the class of problem and the class of methods.

Clustering methods are typically organized by the modeling approaches such as centroid-based and hierarchal. All methods are concerned with using the inherent structures in the data to best organize the data into groups of maximum commonality.

The most popular clustering algorithms are:

k-Means
k-Medians
Expectation Maximisation (EM)
Hierarchical Clustering
Association Rule Learning Algorithms

Assoication Rule Learning Algorithms

Association rule learning methods extract rules that best explain observed relationships between variables in data.

These rules can discover important and commercially useful associations in large multidimensional datasets that can be exploited by an organization.

The most popular association rule learning algorithms are:

Apriori algorithm
Eclat algorithm


Artificial Neural Network Algorithms

Artificial Neural Network Algorithms

Artificial Neural Networks are models that are inspired by the structure and/or function of biological neural networks.

They are a class of pattern matching that are commonly used for regression and classification problems but are really an enormous subfield comprised of hundreds of algorithms and variations for all manner of problem types.

Note that I have separated out Deep Learning from neural networks because of the massive growth and popularity in the field. Here we are concerned with the more classical methods.

The most popular artificial neural network algorithms are:

Perceptron
Back-Propagation
Hopfield Network
Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN)
Deep Learning Algorithms

Deep Learning AlgorithmsDeep Learning methods are a modern update to Artificial Neural Networks that exploit abundant cheap computation.

They are concerned with building much larger and more complex neural networks and, as commented on above, many methods are concerned with semi-supervised learning problems where large datasets contain very little labeled data.

The most popular deep learning algorithms are:

Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM)
Deep Belief Networks (DBN)
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Stacked Auto-Encoders
Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms



Dimensional Reduction Algorithms


Like clustering methods, dimensionality reduction seek and exploit the inherent structure in the data, but in this case in an unsupervised manner or order to summarize or describe data using less information.

This can be useful to visualize dimensional data or to simplify data which can then be used in a supervised learning method. Many of these methods can be adapted for use in classification and regression.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Principal Component Regression (PCR)
Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR)

Mixture Discriminant Analysis (MDA)
Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)
Flexible Discriminant Analysis (FDA)
Ensemble Algorithms




Ensemble Algorithms


Ensemble methods are models composed of multiple weaker models that are independently trained and whose predictions are combined in some way to make the overall prediction.

Much effort is put into what types of weak learners to combine and the ways in which to combine them. This is a very powerful class of techniques and as such is very popular.

Bootstrapped Aggregation (Bagging)
AdaBoost
Stacked Generalization (blending)
